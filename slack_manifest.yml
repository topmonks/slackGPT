  long_description: "Introducing Slack<->ChatGPT (3.5-turbo) bridge - a seamless integration that offers limitless possibilities! The only usage constraint is token count, with a maximum of 4096 tokens. It's wise to avoid exceeding this limit as it may omit important parts of the conversation history, such as context. We ask that you only use what is necessary as we are billed according to the number of tokens used.\r

    To get started, you can use the \\start command to begin a new conversation. This command can also finish any previous conversations if needed. Or you can simply start prompting without the command.\r

    When you're ready to end a current conversation, utilize the \\end command.\r

    As a developer, you have the added advantage of using the \\sys_role __content__ command to give instructions for a conversation. This can include providing options for user input, depending on system requirements. So, what are you waiting for? Start chatting today with Slack<->ChatGPT (3.5-turbo) bridge!\r

    \r

    Commands:\r

    \r

    \\start - Start a new conversation, end the former if exists\r

    \r

    \\end - End current conversation (if exists)\r

    \r

    \\sys_role content - Add System Role (for example: You are the most proffessional programmer and Iam as well, so respond to me only in the context of code)\r

    \r

    \\temp_set (0.0 - 2.0) - Set temperaure, 0.0~most exact, 2.0~'most  creative', default=1.0\r

    \r

    \\max_tokens_set (5 - 4000) - Maximum number of tokens the answer will have, default = 2000\r
